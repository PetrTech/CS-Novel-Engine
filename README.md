# CS Novel Engine
Work in progress. Unusable so far.

## How to compile? (Windows)
Go ahead and install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/cs/vs/older-downloads/">Visual Studio 2019</a>, after that's done, add .NET to your VS19 installation.</br>
If your version of .NET is lower than 5.0, install the 5.0 version from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">here</a>.</br>
Download and install Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">here</a>.<br/>After git is installed, open the Windows Terminal, CMD or PowerShell and run the command: <code>git clone https://github.com/PetrTech/Visual-Novel-Engine.git</code>. This will create a VS19 project that you can now open. (OPEN IT)<br/>
After the project is opened, hit F5 and it will build now. Close the application and clone this <a href="https://github.com/PetrTech/Visual-Novel-Engine-Build-File-Structure/tree/main">repo</a>. Put the resources folder into the build directory (along with the EXE). Now open the .exe and all assets will be loaded from the folder.
